In this article, I'm going to giving an overview of the Forex market and defining some terminology surrounding it :)

Forex is simply the global market that allows the exchange of one currency for another. If you've ever visited another country before, you've probably experience converting your home currency into theirs. After your exciting trip you still somehow have some money left! (I definitely wouldn't). If on the way back home you convert this back into your home currency, you have participated in the Foreign exchange market(usually called "Forex" or "FX").

The foreign exchange market is massive, by far the largest in the world! It has a daily trading volume of over **$5 TRILLION** Compared to The New York Stock Exchange(NYSE) which trades a measly **$22.4 billion** each day.

It is worth saying that only $300-400 billion (5-6%) of the market is traded by retail traders(that's us).

Advances In technology and the invention of the internet has now allowed almost anyone with an internet connection to participate in the Forex market!

Unlike the normal stock exchange the forex market is open **24 hours a day** and **5 days a week**.

In British summertime(GMT+1) this means the market is open from 10 pm Sunday evening to 9 pm Friday evening every week.



## Why Margins flatteSn the playing field

One of the biggest misconceptions people have about trading is they need a significant amount of money to start, with forex this is simply not true! Forex brokers all over the world allow margin trading. This is where the broker will "lend" the trader money. In the UK the limit is 1:30, this means if you put £100 in you'll actually have £3000 worth of buying power tSo invest in currencies. (The reason they do this is as it helps them to get more money through commission).

## Currency pairs

Each currency is quoted in a pair. For example GBP/USD = 1.1050, this means each £1 can buy $1.1050.

A pip is a unit of measurement to express the change in value between two currencies. 

For most currencies in the World the pip is the 4th decimal place of a price quote.

Imagine yesterday GBP/USD = 1.1050 but today GBP = 1.1162 then there has been a 112 pip shift in the market. The amount of money to make or loss from each trade is dependent on the change in pips.

## Profit?? or Loss

Let's keep going with our previous example and say there has been a 112 pip change in our favour, how much money would we have made?

The chart below shows how much money you make per pip with different amounts of money in our account. Say we have a have a micro lot ($1000) then from this trade we would make $0.1 * 112 = $11.2.

Remember leverage? We said if we invested $100 we actually have $3000 worth of purchasing power. Let's say we invested all our money in on the 112 pip trade, we would have made $0.1 * 112 * 3 = $33.2! This is over a 30% shift in one day! 

On average the GBP/USD shifts 160 pips a day, this allows experienced forex traders to quickly make money with very little capital, whereas other areas such as the stock markets often require backing by large hedge funds to made substantial profits.
