Institutional trading is a way of trading by seeing the market from the a different perspective. It involves understanding how larger organisations such as bank's trade. 

I'll be going through the following technqiues and saying the recommended times I use for each technique in my strategy.

It is worth understanding that the foreign exchange market is fractal in the sense that the type of patterns formed on a higher timeframe will also be formed on a lower time frame. So each of the lists of techniques/confirmations below can be used on a smaller time frame to identify sniper entries(trades with very high risk to reward ratios).

## Key elements

1. **Market structure** - The trend of the market, this tells us if we're looking for buys or sells

2. **Fibonacci retracements** - After an impluse move there needs to be a 71-100%(maybe 88) correction move

3. **Imbalance** - An area where wicks do not overlap, it sucks price towards it like a magnet

4. **Liquidity** - Buy above old highs, Sell below old lows(Equal Highs, Equal lows or Singular wick highs/lows)

5. _**Mitigation candle**_ - The candlestick which takes out liqudity(targets the stop losses)

6. _**Wyckoff**_ - the transition from an uptrend to a downtrend

7. _**Candlestick analysis**_ - shows a slow down in momentum


### Market structure

Firstly we have to identify the direction the market is going in.

The market will either be in a uptrend, downtrend or period of consolidation. For our purposes we will only be looking at a market when it is in a uptrend or downtrend and placing buys and sells repsectively.

We can identify when the market is in a downtrend as it forms a series of lower highs and lower lows.

In a uptrend the market forms a series of higher highs and higher lows.

If the market breaks this strucuture it shows us that a potential reversal is happening.

To initally determine the market trend we will use a Daily time frame.

### Fibonacci retracements

For this we will look at the most recent two extrema points to narrow down a focus to an area of interest. 

In the market below for our scale we look at the impulse move from the lower high to the lower low. We then wait for the market to retrace back 78.6% to 100%, this window is show by the purple box in the image below.

It is also worth noting that we calculate this from the bodies of the highest and lowest candles.

We will use a 4H or H timeframe for this technique.

### Imbalance

This is the area where wicks don't overlap

Look for big engulfing candles.

If the candle is bullish than you will be looking at a section which has no bearish candles(including wicks) and no overlapping wicks from bullish candles.

Either the bulls dominated, or the bears dominated.

It acts like a magnet for price to be pulled into.

### Institutional Candle

When we trade we have small volumes relative to the size of the market, each of our trades can be executed at once price because of the small volumes. If a bank executes a trade with a large volume it won't all be executed at one price, they'll be spread over a range. 

This means if you want to place a buy they'll have to force the market to go in the bullish before they they can start buying.

In the Market this looks like a single quick candle travelling in the opposite direction to the surrounds candles, this candle shouldn't have big wicks as the banks have very little uncertainity in what they're doing - wicks come from indecision in the market.

Price is sucked into an insitutional candle.

Open of bullish candle in bearish market is the point of interest and vica versa.

No pullbacks in the market is unhealthy movement.

### Liquidity & Mitigation candle

Liquidity is an area where stop losses accumulate, this is due to a strong belief of support and resistance across the trading community.

The market always moves from liquidity to liquidity

A candle which takes out liquidity is called a mitigation candle

The open of the mitigation candle is our point of interest

If fibonacci retracement levels line up with line of reference it's an extra confirmation

Most volume created: open-midpoint of candle

### Wyckoff

Every trend always starts from consolidation.

The price is the market will go up when demand increases

Accumulation, Distribution, Trending
