Institutional trading is a way of trading by seeing the market from the bank's perspective. 

I'll be going through the following technqiues and saying the recommended times I use for each technique in my strategy.

The stock market is fractal in the sense that the type of patterns formed on a higher timeframe will also be formed on a lower time frame.

## Key elements

1. **Market structure** - The trend of the market, this tells us if we're looking for buys or sells

2. **Fibonacci retracements** - After an impluse move there needs to be a 78.6-100% correction move

3. **Imbalance** - An area where wicks do not overlap, it sucks price towards it like a magnet

4. **Liquidity** - Buy above old highs, Sell below old lows(Equal Highs, Equal lows or Singular wick highs/lows)

5. _**Mitigation candle**_ - The candlestick which takes out liqudity(targets the stop losses)

6. _**Wyckoff**_ - the transition from an uptrend to a downtrend

7. _**Candlestick analysis**_ - shows a slow down in momentum


### Market structure

Firstly we have to identify the direction the market is going in.

The market will either be in a uptrend, downtrend or period of consolidation. For our purposes we will only be looking at a market when it is in a uptrend or downtrend and placing buys and sells repsectively.

We can identify when the market is in a downtrend as it forms a series of lower highs and lower lows.

In a uptrend the market forms a series of higher highs and higher lows.

To initally determine the market trend we will use a Daily time frame.

### Fibonacci retracements

For this we will look at the most recent two extrema points to narrow down a focus to an area of interest. 

In the market below for our scale we look at the impulse move from the lower high to the lower low. We then wait for the market to retrace back 78.6% to 100%, this window is show by the purple box in the image below.

It is also worth noting that we calculate this from the bodies of the highest and lowest candles.

We will use a 4H or H timeframe for this technique.

### Imbalance

This is the area where wicks don't overlap

### Liquidity & Mitigation candle

Liquidity is an area where stop losses accumulate, this is due to a strong belief of support and resistance across the trading community.

The market always moves from liquidity to liquidity

The open of the mitigation candle is our point of interest
