Technical Analysis is the study of ONLY the time series data, the previous price action. Whereas fundamental analysis concerns itself about other factors such as the news.

Here we will only be considering technical analysis to do this we will have to make some hefty assumptions:

1. The market discounts everything
2. Price moves in trends
3. History tends to repeat itselsf

For more information about what these mean, checkout out [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/technicalanalysis.asp).

I'm not going to be discussing  to much more on these assumptions, I believe them to be *partially* true. In my experience of trading technical analysis used independently of other resources can still give reliable gains.

## CandleSticks

The Japanese CandleStick is by far the most common charting tool in the forex industry. A candlestick contains information about a time window. It will show the price at the start and end of this time window, as well as showing the highest and lowest price reached during the time window.

A green candlestick signifies an increases in price and a red candlestick signifies a decrease in price.

## Support and Resistance

Support is a zone( not a line) where if price falls into, will probably bounce back, going upwards, it's shown in orange in the chart below.

Resistance is very similar but also the complete opposite, if price falls into a resistance zone, it will probably bounce back, going downwards, it's shown in green in the chart below.
